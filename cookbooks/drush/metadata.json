{"name":"drush","description":"Installs drush, the Drupal Shell.","long_description":"= DESCRIPTION:\n\nInstalls the Drush CLI tool for Drupal, either via PEAR package or directly from source via Git.\nAlso included is a recipe that can be used to install drush_make via the `drush pm-download` command.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Opscode's php cookbook - http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/php/\n\n= PLATFORMS:\n\nThe following platforms are supported by this cookbook, meaning that the \nrecipes run on these platforms without error.\n\n* Debian\n* Ubuntu\n* CentOS\n\n= RECIPES:\n\n== default:\n\nInstalls drush using the desired `install_method` recipe, and\nalso includes minor recipes to meet dependencies.\n\n== pear:\n\nInstalls drush via PEAR package manager.\n\n== git:\n\nInstall drush via Git from source repository.\n\n== upgrade_pear:\n\nUpgrades PEAR to v1.9.1, which meets minimum required by drush via PEAR.\n\n== install_console_table:\n\nInstalls PEAR Console_Table extension dependency.\n\n== make:\n\nExecutes a drush command to install drush_make.  If the `drush make` command\nis already available, this command will not be run.\n\n= ATTRIBUTES:\n\n== default:\n\n* `node['drush']['install_method']` - Indicates the desired install method, currently either `git` or `pear`.\n* `node['drush']['version']` - Drush preferred state (stable, beta, devel) or version of format x.y.z when install_method is pear (eg. 5.0.0).\nWhen install_method is git, the format is a git reference commit/tag/branch (eg. 31d768a / 7.x-4.x / 7.x-5.0 )\n* `node['drush']['allreleases']` - URL of allreleases.xml for pear to install from preferred states.\n* `node['drush']['make']['version']` - Drush Make version of format x.y\n* `node['drush']['install_dir']` - Where to install Drush via Git.

You may alter the `install_method` and `version`\nattributes appropriately.\n\n== Resource/Provider\n\nThis cookbook includes LWRP. The +drush_execute+ resource is used to execute a drush command. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run.\n\n=== Syntax\n\n  drush_execute \"command\" do\n    cwd drupal_path\n    options %W{views\n                stable\n                ...\n                --use-site-dir=default}\n  end\n\nwhere\n\n* +cwd+ drupal work directory\n* +command+ is the name of the command that will be run\n* +options+ is zero (or more) of the specific command available options\n* +:action+ is the step that the resource will ask the provider to take during the chef-client. +:run+ Default. Indicates that the command should be run or +:nothing+.\n\n","maintainer":"Mark Sonnabaum","maintainer_email":"mark.sonnabaum@acquia.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"debian":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"php":">= 0.99.0"},"recommendations":{"git":">= 0.0.0"},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"drush":"Installs Drush and dependencies.","drush::pear":"Installs Drush via PEAR.","drush::git":"Installs Drush via Git (drupal.org repository)","drush::make":"Installs Drush Make via Drush.
